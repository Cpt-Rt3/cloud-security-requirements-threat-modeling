## Threat Model
## Threat Model Architecture

![Acme Everything Smart – Threat Model Architecture](screenshots/Acme-everything-smart-threat-model-architecture.png)

This architecture diagram illustrates the threat entry points, trust boundaries, control layers, and monitoring flow for the Acme Everything Smart SaaS IoT platform. It demonstrates how identity, encryption, vulnerability management, logging, and optional deception techniques work together to detect, contain, and respond to threats across the cloud application lifecycle.

### Primary Risks
### Threat Actors
### Assumptions

## Environment Setup
### Cloud Platform Assumptions
### Identity & Access
### Logging & Monitoring

## Implementation & Analysis
(How you mapped risks → CCM controls)

## How to Run This Yourself
1. Review architecture assumptions
2. Identify assets and trust boundaries
3. Map threats to CCM control families
4. Document gaps and recommendations

## Results & Evidence
(Key findings, major gaps, security posture)

## Executive Summary
(Leadership-level takeaway — no jargon)

## Tools Used
- Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)
- Azure (assumed)
- SIEM (Splunk – conceptual)
- Identity Provider (Okta – conceptual)

## Closing Note

This project demonstrates a security-first mindset grounded in practical threat modeling and control mapping. While Acme Everything Smart is fictional, the risks, controls, and architectural patterns reflect real-world cloud security challenges faced by modern SaaS and IoT platforms.
