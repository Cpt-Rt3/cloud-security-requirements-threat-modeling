2. Identify assets and trust boundaries
3. Map threats to CCM control families
4. Document gaps and recommendations

## Results & Evidence
(Key findings, major gaps, security posture)

## Executive Summary
(Leadership-level takeaway — no jargon)

## Tools Used
- Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)
- Azure (assumed)
- SIEM (Splunk – conceptual)
- Identity Provider (Okta – conceptual)
